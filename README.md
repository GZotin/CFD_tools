# CFD_tools

**CFD Tools** is a software developed in Visual Basic to assist engineers in performing fundamental calculations in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. This is the first version of the program, currently under development, featuring a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Reynolds Number Calculation**: Estimate the flow regime based on fluid properties and system dimensions.
  
- **Initial Conditions for Turbulence Models**:
  - k-epsilon Models
  - k-omega Models
  - Spalart-Allmaras Model

- **First Cell Height Calculation for Inflation Layer**: Determine the required height of the first cell in the boundary layer for a desired y+ value.

## How to Use

1. Download the program executable.
2. Run the program and select the desired functionality.
3. Enter the necessary data and click "Calculate".
